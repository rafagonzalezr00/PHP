A factorial is a multiplication of all the natural numbers contained between one and the number itself. For example: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
A prime number is a number than can only be divided by one and the number itself (without decimals). For example: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc, are prime numbers. However, 4 is not a prime number because 2*2=4.
A primorial is just a factorial, but instead of using all the natural numbers contained, it just uses the prime numbers. For example, the primorial of 5 would be: 5# = 5*3*2*1 = 30.
