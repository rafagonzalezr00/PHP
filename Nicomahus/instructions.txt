Consider the following property discovered by Nicomachus of Gerasa:

Adding the first odd number, the first cube is got.
Adding the two following odd numbers, the second cube is got.
Adding the three following odd numbers, the third cube is got, etc.

Check it out:
1^3 = 1 = 1
2^3 = 3 + 5 = 8
3^3 = 7 + 9 + 11 = 27
4^3 = 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 64

Code a program that receives from the user a number "n", that represents the amount of cube numbers they want to get (4 in the example). You need display the solution as in the example shown before.
