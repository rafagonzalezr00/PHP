Spain is a country that loves betting games. To honor it, you are going to build a particular betting game, a "quiniela".
In this betting game, you have 15 matches between the teams of La Liga (a soccer competition), and you need to predict who wins the match in this way:
1. If the local team wins, it is a "1".
2. If the two teams tie, it is an "X".
3. If the visitor team wins, it is a "2".

You can take this one as an example:

What you are going to do is to code a random system that uses probabilities to generate a "quiniela". We need to assume that a "1" has a 50% chance of occuring, an "X" a 20%, and a "2" a 30%. The goal is to help the user to become rich.
The output should be an HTML page with a solution, and with some aesthetic design.
